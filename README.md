# JavaScript: Reading, Understanding and Refactoring Code

Reading, understanding and refactoring other peoples code is an important part of Software Development. 

In these exercises you will find some passing tests and some code solutions. 

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to bring this tired old JavaScript code into the 21st century! ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ•º

Have a go at refactoring the code solutions in exercises001 using what you have learnt about Modern JavaScript and ES6 (const/let, different ways of writing functions, ES6 methods, spread syntax and more).

Make sure you don't break anything so keep running those tests and comitting to GitHub regularly!

````npm i```
````npm test````

Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
